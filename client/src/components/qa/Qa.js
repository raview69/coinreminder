                    What is Crypto Market Cap?
                </h2>
                <p className="text-sm sm:text-lg font-extralight">
                    Crypto market cap is the total value of all the coins of a
                    particular cryptocurrency that have been mined or are in
                    circulation. Market capitalization is used to determine the
                    ranking of cryptocurrencies. The higher the market cap of a
                    particular crypto coin, the higher its ranking and share of
                    the market. Crypto market cap is calculated by multiplying
                    the total number of coins in circulation by its current
                    price. For instance, to calculate the market cap of
                    Ethereum, all you need to do is multiply the total number of
                    Ethereum in circulation by the current price of one Ethereum
                    and you will get its market cap.

                    How to compare Cryptocurrencies Market Cap?

                <p className="text-sm sm:text-lg font-extralight">
                    Crypto market cap can be divided into three categories:
                </p>
                <ul className="text-sm sm:text-lg font-extralight">
                    <li>- Large-cap cryptocurrencies ($10 billion)</li>
                    <li>
                        - Mid-cap Cryptocurrencies ($1 billion - $10 billion)
                    </li>
                    <li>- Small-cap cryptocurrencies ($1 billion)</li>
                </ul>
                &nbsp;
                <p className="text-sm sm:text-lg font-extralight">
                    As a financial metric, market cap allows you to compare the
                    total circulating value of one cryptocurrency with another.
                    Large cap cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have
                    a market cap of over $10 billion. They typically consist of
                    protocols that have demonstrated track records, and have a
                    vibrant ecosystem of developers maintaining and enhancing
                    the protocol, as well as building new projects on top of
                    them. While market cap is a simple and intuitive comparison
                    metric, it is not a perfect point of comparison. Some
                    cryptocurrency projects may appear to have inflated market
                    cap through price swings and the tokenomics of their supply.
                    As such, it is best to use this metric as a reference
                    alongside other metrics such as trading volume, liquidity,
                    fully diluted valuation, and fundamentals during your
                    research process.
